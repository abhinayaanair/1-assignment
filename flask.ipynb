    "\n",
    "   A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications over the web. It allows different software systems to communicate with each other using standard HTTP protocols. Web APIs expose endpoints that can be accessed using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, enabling developers to perform operations such as retrieving data, submitting forms, and updating records.\n",

Web services are typically used for machine-to-machine communication, providing a structured way to exchange data. SOAP web services use XML-based messaging, whereas RESTful web services use simpler, lightweight formats like JSON.\n",

    "40. What are Flask templates, and how are they used in web development?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flask templates are HTML files used to create dynamic web pages. Flask utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine, allowing Python-like expressions within HTML. Templates are stored in a templates directory. The render_template function in Flask renders these templates and passes data to them. This enables dynamic content generation based on server-side data or logic. For instance, using {{ variable }} in a template allows inserting values dynamically. Control structures like loops and conditionals can also be used to manipulate HTML content. This approach helps in separating business logic from presentation, making the web application more maintainable and scalable.\n",
